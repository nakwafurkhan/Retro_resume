The project consists of the following files:

/retro-web-resume │ ├── index.html ├── skills.html ├── projects.html ├── contact.html ├── styles.css └── scripts.js

### Files
- **HTML Files:** Each file represents a different section of the resume.
  - `index.html`: Home page
  - `skills.html`: Skills page
  - `projects.html`: Projects page
  - `contact.html`: Contact page
- **CSS File:** `styles.css` contains all the styles for the project, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all pages.
